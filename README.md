## Installation

To set up the Terreform project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a keypair**: Generate the keypair with the command below:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/your-key
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dinh-le2701/rsschool-devops-course-tasks.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd rsschool-devops-course-tasks
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**: Initialize the Terraform working directory. This step downloads the necessary provider plugins:

   ```bash
   # backend.conf file
   bucket  = "<PUT-S3-BUCKET-NAME-FOR-TERRAFORM-STATES>"
   region  = "<PUT-AWS-REGION>"
   key     = "state/terraform.tfstate"
   encrypt = true
   ```

   ```bash
   terraform init -backend-config=./path/to/backend.conf
   ```
   
## Usage

To use the Terreform project, follow these steps:

1. **Plan the Infrastructure**: Generate and review an execution plan for the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   This command will show you what actions Terraform will take to change your infrastructure.

2. **Apply the Infrastructure**: Apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
	Enter token for K3S when prompted. Confirm the action when prompted. 
	Terraform will provision the resources as defined in the configuration files.

3. **Destroy the Infrastructure**: If you need to remove the infrastructure, use the following command:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted. This will delete all the resources managed by Terraform.


# Bastion host usage


1. **Make the key accessible from remote via tunnels to have access from bastion to private instances**:

   ```bash
   ssh-add  ~/.ssh/path_to_your_key
   ```
2. **Verify connection to the bastion**:

   ```bash
   ssh -A -i ~/.ssh/path_to_your_key ubuntu@<PUT_PUBLIC_IP_OR_HOST_OF BASTION_INSTANCE>
   ```

3. **Connect from the bastion host to a private EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -A ubuntu@<PUT_PRIVATE_IP>
   ```


# K8S cluster with [k3s](https://k3s.io/)

## 1. Verify the Master Node (Control plan)

1. **Connect from the bastion host to the Control plan EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -A ubuntu@<PUT_PRIVATE_IP>
   ```
2. **Check status of k3s on master node**
    ```bash
    systemctl status k3s
    ```
   
## 2. Check the nodes list from master node
1. **Connect from the bastion host to the Control plan EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -A ubuntu@<PUT_PRIVATE_IP>
   ```
   
2. Execute command to get the nodes list
    ```bash
    sudo kubectl get nodes
    ```
    Please see the expected output:
    ```bash
    ubuntu@ip-10-0-2-58:~$ sudo kubectl get nodes
	NAME           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE    VERSION
	ip-10-0-2-38   Ready    <none>                 108s   v1.30.5+k3s1
	ip-10-0-2-58   Ready    control-plane,master   115s   v1.30.5+k3s1
    ```
   

## 3. Deploy a Simple Workload
1. Deploy a Simple Workload

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/simple-pod.yaml
   ```

2. Verify that the pod is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

4. Verify the deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments
   ```
